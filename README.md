# Updated-Portfolio-Page

# This is my homework #8 - Updated Portfolio Page.

You can find my first portfolio I built in the following link.

https://github.com/jung0808/homework-2

In this homework, I still used HTML & CSS to update my page.

However, this time I divided the sections into more manageable strucutres. My body contains "div" for first container which contains the welcome portion with mountains and cloud.

The "div" middle container, contains my profile picture along with a bio about me, plus my skills section.

The "div" bottom container, contains my linkedin, twitter, and facebook information.

Building the updated portfloio page second time around was much easier than doing it the first time. I'm hoping, I can continue to build on this effort as I continue to incorporate some of the information I learned class into developing my portfolio page!

Thank you for reading! You can find my live porfolio in the link below. ðŸ˜Š
